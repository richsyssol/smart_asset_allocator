    question:
      "Is there any eligibility criterion for having a health insurance policy?",
    answer:
      "Anyone above the age of 3 months (for the health floater plan) can take a health insurance policy. However, the insurer may ask you to go through a medical check-up to ascertain your health condition before issuing the policy. Based on underwriting guidelines that consider age, health condition, family history, etc., the insurer will determine whether to provide you with a health plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are TPAs?",
    answer:
      "TPAs or third-party administrators act as intermediaries between insurance companies, policyholders, and hospitals. A TPA helps policyholders settle claims hassle-free by establishing communication between the policyholder, the treating hospital, and the insurer. However, it's advisable to choose a company that has in-house claim settlement rather than relying on TPAs.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is NCB (No Claim Bonus)?",
    answer:
      "‘No Claim Bonus’ is an additional sum insured offered by the insurer on policy renewal for customers who had no claims in the preceding year. It is calculated as a percentage of the sum insured and typically ranges from 5% to 100%. It is advisable to ensure that the plan you choose offers the maximum NCB.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does health insurance cover?",
    answer:
      "A health insurance policy covers all expenses related to hospitalization. You need to be hospitalized for a continuous 24 hours to avail of the benefit. Additionally, it covers expenses for daycare procedures, pre and post-hospitalization, ambulance charges, donor expenses, and more. We advise you to read the coverage terms carefully before purchasing a plan.",
